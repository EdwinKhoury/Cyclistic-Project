# **Visual Representation of Findings**

## **Bikes and Users**

![Type of Bikes and Users](https://github.com/EdwinKhoury/Cyclistic-Project/assets/146214280/729cb223-5891-4582-be25-c0b282399168)

Casual riders have fewer trips (1,485,338) than member riders (2,614,235). This indicates that riders who are members go on rides more often than casual riders, and that might be because of the lower price for a single ride when taking a membership. Also, for both types of users, the classic bikes are more used than the electric ones. This can be related to the price of each bike as well as the needs of the riders.


## **Monthly Analysis**

The most used trajectory by the riders is Streeter Dr & Grand Ave - Streeter Dr & Grand Ave with a total of 9052 rides. Since it is the busiest station, the bike company might consider adding more bikes at this station 
to accommodate the high demand.
