Casual riders have fewer trips (1,485,338) than member riders (2,614,235). This indicates that riders who are members 
go on rides more often than casual riders, and that might be because of the lower price for a single ride when taking a membership.
Also, for both types of users, the classic bikes are more used than the electric ones. This can be related to the price of each bike
as well as the needs of the riders.
